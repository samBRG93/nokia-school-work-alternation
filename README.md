# Predicting Londonâ€™s Weather: ML Model Lifecycle & Deployment

This project focuses on building a complete Machine Learning (ML) pipeline to 
predict the daily mean temperature in London. 
It incorporates DataOps (via Great Expectations) and MLOps (via MLflow), 
ensuring data quality, model tracking, and deployment.

 
## Source Data

We are using the London Weather Dataset available on Kaggle:
https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/emmanuelfwerr/london-weather-data
This dataset spans from 1979 to 2021 and has been pre-cleaned for ease of use.

## Data Operations (DataOps)

We utilize Great Expectations to validate data quality at different stages:
Raw Data Validation: Ensuring integrity before processing.
Baseline Data Validation: Checking cleaned data post-ETL (Extract, Transform, Load)

## Machine Learning Model

Our primary model is XGBoost (Extreme Gradient Boosting), a high-performance model for tabular data. We will compare its performance against other models, such as Random Forest.

## Machine Learning Operations (MlOps)

We use Mlflow to manage the ML lifecycle:
Track ML experiments and compare model parameters.
Version control to identify the best-performing models.

## Mlflow Deployment

Mlflow will be used as a local inference server:

## Data Visualization (Optional)
Using Matplotlib, we will create visualizations to gain insights from the dataset.

## Considerations & documentation

This is a regression problem, as we aim to predict a continuous variable (temperature).

### Data challenges in Real-world Applications
While this dataset is pre-cleaned, real-world data is often:  
Noisy (contains errors or inconsistencies)
Dynamic (changes over time)  
Subject to data drift, which can degrade model performance over time.
